This creates a folder called venv which contains the isolated Python environment.
python3 -m venv venv

# To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
source venv/bin/activate


You can also generate it later using:


pip freeze > requirements.txt


Install all packages listed in requirements.txt:


pip install -r requirements.txt

OpenAI embedding models
text-embedding-3-small $0.02
text-embedding-3-large $0.13 
text-embedding-ada-002 $0.10

ðŸ“Š Summary
Model	Embedding Size	Max Input Tokens
textâ€‘embeddingâ€‘3â€‘small	1,536 dims	8,191 tokens
textâ€‘embeddingâ€‘3â€‘large	3,072 dims	8,191 tokens
textâ€‘embeddingâ€‘adaâ€‘002	1,536 dims	8,191 tokens

All three models allow up to 8,191 tokens in a single embedding request.


Even though the vector format looks the same, the quality and meaning of those numbers depend on the model:

Model	Vector Size	Semantic Quality	Speed/Cost
all-MiniLM-L6-v2	384	Good (small, efficient)	Fast, free
text-embedding-ada-002	1,536	Strong	Low-cost (OpenAI)
text-embedding-3-small	1,536	Newer, better than Ada	Low-cost (OpenAI)
text-embedding-3-large	3,072	Highest quality	Higher cost
